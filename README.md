# Smart-India-Hackathon-2023
Hi there! I have participated once for SIH and I could only make it through the Internal Hackthon. 
I was hoping to at least secure a spot in the SIH finals so that I could also participate in an actual offline hackathon, and have fun with my friends over there.
But no matter! 
This was not the end of the world and I will surely be able to participate in similar events later on!

(Why am I writing all this?? I won't be able to participate in SIH anymore due to their criteria and my shortcomings..)


Any related files that can be publicly available, I have uploaded it here!! Feel free to check it out and comment what changes I could have made for selection to SIH Finals.
